# riemann-timeseries

An influxdb sink for riemann. This enables riemann to persist events into
Influxdb.

## Directory structure
`riemann-timeseries/` is where the code resides

`influxdb/` and `riemann/` contain the configuration files and data for both
services.

I have included two scripts `start-influxdb` and `start-riemann` to help
starting the services. They are smart to set everything up, so the initial setup
is minimal. You basically just need to run `start-influxdb` to have a running
instance of Influxdb; the same goes for `start-riemann`.

## Usage
The first thing to do is to build an uber jar, so cd into `riemann-timeseries`
and run

```
lein uberjar
```

When that's done, run `start-influxdb` first, and then run `start-riemann`. You
can take a look at a look at the script `start-riemann` and see how I configure the
classpath, and `riemann/riemann.config` to see how to use the store events into
Influxdb.

### Riemann config
In your riemann.config, you can define a stream like the following:
```
(let [index (index)
      ;; Location of influxdb and credential
      influxdb-client (i/client :db "riemann"
                                :host "localhost"
                                :port 8086
                                :username "root"
                                :password "root")
      ;; Table to save the metrics to
      influxdb-table-name "all"]

  ; Inbound events will be passed to these streams:
  (streams

    index

    (->Influxdb influxdb-client influxdb-table-name)

    ; Log expired events.
    (expired
      (fn [event] (info "expired" event)))))
```

### Create an influxdb database
Remember to create an influxdb database using the influxdb's admin UI. If you
are using the above rieman.config, you will need to create a database called
`riemann`. Then, all the data will be saved to table, `all`, in database
`riemann`.
